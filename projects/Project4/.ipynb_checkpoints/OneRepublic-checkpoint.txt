Woah
Woah

You bring an energy I've never felt before
Some kind of chemical that reaches through my core
Feels like as far as you and me, I've never had a choice
You feel like home, hmm
You like the opposite of all of my mistakes (hey)
Tear down the biggest walls and put me in my place
I know, that kind of comfortable you cannot replicate
You feel like home, hmm

So if you're asking me
Say, "Oh, how do you know?"
I don't just feel it in my heart
Don't just feel it in my heart, no

I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
And I know when it cuts deep down through your chest into your soul
That's how you know, that's how I know
I feel it in my bones (hey)
(Hey)
And I know when it cuts deep down through your chest into your soul (hey)
That's how you know, that's how I know
I feel it in my bones

So many people just walk in and out your life (hey)
I'd trade a couple hundred just to get some time back, that's right
'Cause for you and me, I got no alibi
You feel like home, oh

So if you're asking me
Sayin', "Oh, how do you know?"
I don't just feel it in my heart
Don't just feel it in my heart, no

I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones, yeah
And I know when it cuts deep down through your chest into your soul
That's how you know, that's how I know
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones (hey)
I feel it in my bones
Oh, that's how you know, that's how I know

So if you're asking me
Said, "Boy, how do you know?"
I don't just feel it in my heart
Don't just feel it in my heart, no

I feel it in my bones (hey)
I feel it in my bones, yeah (hey)
And I know when it cuts deep down through your chest into your soul (hey)
That's how you know, that's how I know
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones (hey)
I feel it in my bones (hey)
Oh, that's how you know, that's how I know
I feel it in my bones
